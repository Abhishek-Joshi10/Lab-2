# Lab-2
Lab 2- Github
The code here consists of two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbour
The dataset used is Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data set
The coding is performed in Jupyter Notebook
The IPYNB files contains the code
The Html files contain the post run code, easier to read
These steps are performed in these code
  1. Importing Neccessary Libraries
  2. Loading the dataset as dataframe
  3. Exploratory Data Analysis
  4. Feature Engineering  
    a. One hot Encoding
    b. Standardization
  5. Machine Learning Models  ( Different Files)
    a. Logistic Regression 
    b. KNN
 The dataset is available as "dataset.csv"
 Note: Code in both files is same except in the end model is different.
